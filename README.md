#### Description:

This project comprises a static website devoid of complex back-end features involving data storage or user input through sign-ups and logins. Thus, these decisions were made by choice. The focus would thus be laid on a much deeper understanding of JavaScript before moving deeper into more advanced areas. The website consists of four HTML pages, each separate in function, yet woven together in design and function. The index page is an introduction to a delightful raccoon image gallery. The gallery presents a curated selection of the cutest and silliest raccoon photographs, distinctly titled for character and flair.  
A prominent logo was at the top on the left side of the index page so that people would easily be oriented toward visual branding. The navigation was rather problematic because it required consensus between getting the titles to fit into the navigation bar and maintaining a balance and readability. A solution was adopted that right-aligned the navigation titles to achieve an organized yet appealing look. An addition made to the index page is a contact link, with an icon that helps to differentiate it from the other sections in a visual way. Mismatched or varied Google fonts were plucked from multiple places to give a sense of style merging professionalism into playfulness. The page would also introduce the "about" section, which rather quickly gives a few ideas behind the project.  
The contact form page, though not fully fleshed out for submissions to the backend, is equipped with validations for fields being completely filled in and the email box containing an actual email address. It gives a little taste of real-world interaction while sticking to the static quality of the project. The design closely resembles the other pages so as not to confuse the user. Meanwhile, the 'about' page becomes a light-hearted section that further expounds on the website, letting the visitors connect with the project in a more meaningful way. To keep it interesting, the page has a 'bonus' raccoon image, an unexpected treat for those perusing the site. With that comes also a retail page, complete with items for sale and pictures and descriptions for each. This also integrates modern interactive elements, such as an image carousel that allows users to glide through multiple images of a single product.  
The CSS has been designed to suit a clean, cute, and engaging look. Pastel-pink colors and round corners were nice touches throughout with a friendly and inviting look that extends across all the pages. Responsivity ensures the site looks good and works well across all devices of different sizes-from mobile devices to desktop monitors. Great emphasis was given to hover states and animation transitions which give the site great flair. A custom scrollbar has been used to offer great polish, where layout considerations for the gallery and store grids were made that accommodate very nicely into any given arrangement. The image carousel for the Zoey spider store was designed with user experience in mind, creating seamless navigation through multiple images of any one product. The general style does fit that playful and approachable theme, giving visitors an enjoyable browsing experience.  
The JavaScript features are designed to be simple and efficient. All code exists in a DOMContentLoaded event to operate only once the DOM completely loads, thus protecting against runtime failures. Key constants are declared for selecting important elements from the HTML using the DOM functions so they can be manipulated dynamically as and when required. Carting functionality is another main feature of the JavaScript implementation. Cart data is initialized and stored in localStorage so that the cart's state would persist across page refreshes. This guarantees users the ability to continue their shopping experience without losing their selected items.  
The cart badge visibility is dependent on whether there are items in the cart. The change is done automatically by a function that handles this update behind the scenes so that the user experience is seamless. The items that were added to the cart are rendered dynamically through a function which creates HTML elements for each cart item and shows the name, quantity, and price. Another function calculates and returns the total price of cart items, thereby providing feedback to users on their shopping total in real time. An event listener has been added to the “add to cart” buttons, allowing items to be pushed into the cart array where count and price are tracked. Each cart item is also endowed with a "remove" button, allowing users to remove individual items from the cart without any hassle.  
The image carousel on the store page represents one of the more advanced JavaScript features that allow visitors to browse product images in an interactive manner. This functionality shows how an enhancement to user experience using JavaScript acts by introducing more lively features to an almost static website.The project strikes a good balance of functionality and design by combining all these factors; a solid base for further development following the satisfactory user experience it offers. An emphasis on front-end and JavaScript, therefore, provides the foundation for more elaborate development in the future. With a fun raccoon theme and interactive features, the website acts as an educational experiment as well as showcasing creativity and technical skills.
